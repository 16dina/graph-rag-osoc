    The following are all the labels for the decisions in the decisions dataset and their URIs:

    {concepts_and_labels}

    Based on the user's question: {user_question}, go through all the labels then choose at least 1 label that best matches the question's theme and context. 

    Get the URIs of the chosen label(s), these will be used in the next step.

    NEXT STEP:

    The following are examples of user questions in Dutch and their corresponding SPARQL queries:

    {example_queries}

    Based on the examples above and the URIs of the chosen labels, generate a SPARQL query for the following user question:

    User Question: {user_question}
    SPARQL Query:

    But please make sure to use the URIs of the chosen labels in the "?annotation oa:hasBody" part of the query like in the examples. 
    
    If there is more than one URI, you can separate them with a comma. 
    
    Make sure to not include any extra spaces or '\n' characters in the query.

    Give only the query as the answer.
