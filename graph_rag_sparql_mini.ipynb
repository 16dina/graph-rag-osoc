        "# SPARQL Graph RAG Demo\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "A minimal, special case, proof-of-concept in which a SPARQL store is used as a source (/cache) of structured data to use in concert with an LLM in a Retrieval Augmented Generation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "[OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) key required to run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Functionally it mimics the behaviour of a previous demo designed to use a more traditional enterprise graph database as a source of data. In addressing a SPARQL store to obtain data to augment the LLM, this concept is proven.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Linked Data context, there's also a novel aspect which manifests from a side effect of mimicking the previous work. The data used is initially derived from a Wikipedia document, the triples being created from text using NLP techniques. Such approaches are the subject of ongoing research elsewhere, not in the immediate scope here.\n",
        "\n",
        "But a closer offshoot, almost certainly worthy of further investigation, is the availability of a pipeline from an LLM + RAG system back to a SPARQL store. Conceptually this mirrors the often overlooked notion of the Web as a read/write knowledgebase. A SPARQL store can be viewed as a cache, a medium-term memory of (perhaps domain-specific) data from Linked Data/the Web at large. This could also contain information that's a result of LLM-style reasoning.    \n",
        "\n",
        "This demo is currently using my (danja) fork of LlamaIndex. Perhaps when I've tidied things up, it might find it's way into the main repo. But the idea here was simply to gauge the amount of work involved to to hook into a SPARQL store to provide augmentation. By trivial extension, this could include potentially any Linked Data, or for that matter any information on the Web, exploiting the knowledge captured by it's structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "There was moderate effort involved in writing something that was compatible with an existing toolset, but aside from that requirement, there really isn't anything new in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "LlamaIndex was used here as a route into exploring this area. But in general, this approach is overkill. Standard libraries that are commonly used in other contexts (with appropriate configuration or at most minor modification) can supply all the necessary functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, with a small amount of glue code, there is a massive amount of very low hanging fruit.    \n",
        "\n",
        "## Background\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models are a significant breakthrough in knowledge representation and look to be useful in countless domains. But there are certain clear issues with the current state of the art.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most obvious is the expense of training. Systems like [OpenAI's GPT](https://openai.com/) family yield typically monolithic architures with preset knowledge. Fine-tuning is one way around this, taking a general-purpose base model and giving it other information to operate on a particular range of tasks But fine-tuning is still non-trivial in practice and is again expensive in terms of the resources required.\n",
        "\n",
        "But there other approaches to get around this intrinsic lack of flexibility. [Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401) (RAG) is one such. The initial RAG technique used vector databases for encoding the data to be used in augmentation. However recent work has demonstrated that Knowledge Graphs can potentially fulfil this role in a more productive fashion. *At which point the ears of someone with a background in the Web and [Linked Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data) prick up.*\n",

        "\n",
        "The aim here is to replicate a part of [Wey Gu](https://siwei.io/en/)'s Jupyter [Notebook](https://www.siwei.io/en/demos/graph-rag/), where [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) uses a graph store. In that Notebook a [NebulaGraph](https://www.nebula-graph.io/) store is used, here a SPARQL store.\n",
